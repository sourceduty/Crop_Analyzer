[Crop Analyzer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-tsl3ADsYf-crop-analyzer) helps farmers with the analysis of agricultural images. Its primary function is to evaluate the growth stage and overall health of crops based on visual cues from provided images. It identifies specific growth stages, such as leaf development, flowering, or fruiting, to give users a clear understanding of where their crops are in their growth cycle. This helps farmers and agricultural professionals monitor crop progress and make informed decisions about cultivation practices.

In addition to growth stage identification, the Crop Analyzer assesses the health of the crops by examining attributes like color, vigor, and uniformity of growth. It looks for signs of stress, such as wilting, discoloration, or stunted growth, which can indicate underlying issues. The tool also detects anomalies that may suggest the presence of diseases, pests, or nutrient deficiencies. By describing visible symptoms—such as spots on leaves, unusual growth patterns, or damage to fruit—it provides a preliminary diagnosis to help users address potential problems.

The Crop Analyzer concludes each analysis with tailored recommendations based on its findings. It may suggest closer monitoring, laboratory testing, or consulting with an agricultural expert for a more accurate diagnosis. While it doesn’t prescribe specific chemical treatments, it emphasizes the importance of timely intervention to mitigate issues and improve crop health. Overall, this custom GPT aims to support agricultural productivity by providing detailed, accessible, and practical insights into crop conditions.
